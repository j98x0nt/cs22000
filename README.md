Human Sciences: From Cells toSocieties
WORD LENGTH: 2,000 words maximum +/- 10%. In text referencing will be included in the word count. End of text reference list is not included in the word count. 
REFERENCING: 8+ references are expected. Please use a consistent academic referencing style. (Harvard or APA). 
SUBMISSION: Submit your essay via the 'Assignments' / 'Final Essay' tab. 
Important things to note: you will only have one essay submission attempt via Turnitin. Once your essay is submitted we cannot delete the file (e.g if you upload the wrong file) and allow a second submission. It is your responsibility to submit the correct file. 
MARKING: The marking rubric (provided on LMS) outlines the primary criteria for marking this assignment. You are expected to use perspectives from core disciplines (evolutionary ecology, biomedicine, psychology, geography). 
LATE PENALTIES: Penalties will apply for late submission (5% deduction per 'WORKING' day - i.e. Saturday and Sunday are not included as days that would accrue a late penalty), unless an extension has been granted. Essays submitted later than 5 days after the due date will not be marked, therefore receiving no marks. 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: If the need arises - e.g. medical reasons – an application (with documentation) for an extension of up to one week should be made to Clare Walter (cwalter@unimelb.edu.au) before the due date. If a longer extension is required, please refer to the Student Portal (or see http://students.unimelb.edu.au/admin/special). 
MAJOR ESSAY TASK: 
Choose an epidemic or pandemic infectious disease (e.g. cholera, HIV, COVID-19) OR consider the following hypothetical ‘Agouti virus’ scenario 
The recent Agouti virus outbreak in East Asia is a population health emergency of international concern. In the past six months, it has already resulted in over 12,000 cases in East Asia. In recent weeks, three cases of Agouti virus ha代 写Human Sciences: From Cells toSocietiesMatlab

More advanced symptoms appear between 4 to 10 days. The virus can cause haemorrhagic fever.  There is no specific treatment for the virus, but early diagnosis and hospitalisation can aid recovery. The disease has an estimated case fatality rate of 20%. Rates of Agouti virus mutation are high: their genomes can accrue genetic differences while spreading geographically; the virus is able to adapt rapidly to novel environments. Humans can contract the infection through exposure to infected saliva, faeces and urine from rodents or contaminated dust where infected rodents live; rodents are the primary reservoirs worldwide. Factors that affect exposure to the virus include farm work, herding, sleeping on the ground and poor housing conditions that increase contact between humans and rodents. Wild rodent hosts are most frequently found in rural or semi-rural areas. The outbreak in East Asia was preceded by an unusually wet conditions caused by a strong La Niña event. The rains boosted the food supply available to rodents (insects, vegetation) leading to 10-fold increase in their population. Agouti virus has had substantial health consequences for individuals, families and communities, and increased burden on essential health services. 
Answer the following question: 
Discuss how different disciplines – i.e. evolutionary ecology, biomedicine, psychology, geography – contribute to understanding of infectious disease pandemic/epidemic threats. Focus on the infectious disease you have chosen. You could consider aspects of disease transmission and/or disease control. 
Note: Choose a central theme to give your essay focus: e.g. health system strengthening, infection as expression of social disadvantage, zoonotic disease.
